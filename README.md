# Project 1: Team Orlando Planners


## **Orange Swan Planning**

For our first project, Alex Oh, Claus Sabin, David Hawkins and Marisa Quijano teamed up to create a new travel web page focusing on Orlando, Florida. The idea was to create a page using two API's, the Skyscanner and Google Places, so that the user may go to the website, search departing flights to Orlando from 40 different major airports and find their flight easily. Next, when the user plans their flight they can also plan their day using Google Places, search local restaurants, events and Theme Park information. The page would eventually be all inclusive, the user could go to Orange Swan Planning to easily create a travel itinerary including flight, dining, event and theme park plans. 

__*Phase two of the project*__ the user would be able to sign in, save their searches and comment to other users about their experiences and suggestions to plan their Orlando based vacation using Orange Swan Planning.


### **The Process**

To begin Alex Oh and David Hawkins researched two API's that would be used for our web page. Once the API's were chosen, Claus Sabin and Marisa Quijano began the Front End design of the page. The team worked in two parts, Front and Back End, to build a site that is pleasing to the eye, user friendly and has the potential for future development. There was constant communication, review and editing between both the Front and Back End Developers throughout the project.
